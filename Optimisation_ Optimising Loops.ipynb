They take time to implement themselves and, more importantly, cause sections of code to be repeated a potentially very large number of times. Thus, when optimising, it is very often loops where we will look to optimise first (assuming this is what the profiling leads us to believe is important).\n","\n","When optimising loops, a general principle is to optimise the innermost loop first as its contents will always be carried out more times than any other.\n","\n","If it's possible to eliminate a loop, this is almost always advantageous. This may be done by noticing the loop is expressible as a mutlplication, arithmetic sum, geometric sum, etc.\n","\n","## List comprehensions\n","\n","One way to remove a loop is to replace it with a [list comprehension](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-list-comprehension). Due to time constraints, we're not going to offer a full discussion of list comprehensions here, but the example below should give you a rough idea of how to use one. This syntax is able to populate a list without an explicit ```for``` loop and the lack of the loop speeds up the code considerably.
