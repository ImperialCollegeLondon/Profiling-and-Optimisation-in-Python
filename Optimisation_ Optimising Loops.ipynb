They take time to implement themselves and, more importantly, cause sections of code to be repeated a potentially very large number of times. Thus, when optimising, it is very often loops where we will look to optimise first (assuming this is what the profiling leads us to believe is important).\n","\n","When optimising loops, a general principle is to optimise the innermost loop first as its contents will always be carried out more times than any other.\n","\n","If it's possible to eliminate a loop, this is almost always advantageous. This may be done by noticing the loop is expressible as a mutlplication, arithmetic sum, geometric sum, etc.\n","\n","## List comprehensions\n","\n","One way to remove a loop is to replace it with a [list comprehension](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-list-comprehension). Due to time constraints, we're not going to offer a full discussion of list comprehensions here, but the example below should give you a rough idea of how to use one. This syntax is able to populate a list without an explicit ```for``` loop and the lack of the loop speeds up the code considerably. For example, take the code: "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Z7XXWpPvJimi","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!pip install line_profiler\n","%load_ext line_profiler\n","\n","def make_list():\n","  #This function makes a lsit of a million elements with each being equal to the square of its index\n","  my_list=[]\n","\n","  for i in range(1000000):\n","    my_list.append(i**2)\n","\n","  return(my_list)\n","\n","%lprun -f make_list print(make_list()[-10:])"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JXNopKZwMrAn","colab_type":"text"},"source":["We can replace the ```for``` loop with a list comprehension:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"61PeV6ILMv_l","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!pip install line_profiler\n","%load_ext line_profiler\n","\n","def make_list():\n","  #This function makes a lsit of a million elements with each being equal to the square of its index\n","  my_list=[i**2 for i in range(1000000)]\n","\n","  return(my_list)\n","\n","%lprun -f make_list print(make_list()[-10:])"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iRNty5agNMkt","colab_type":"text"},"source":["This runs much faster and is also more compact and arguably easier to read once you're familiar with the syntax.\n","\n","## The ```Map``` Function\n","\n","The map operates on every entry of an interable (such as a ```list```) with a specified function and returns an iterable with the results.
