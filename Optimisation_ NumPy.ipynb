Lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are inherently slow and inefficient. If you're handling large amouns of data in a performance-critical area of your code, substantail gains can be made by using other data types to store your data.\n","\n","One of the most popular ways of holding large amounts of data  is through the use of the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) package. NumPy provides access to the powerful array data type which can store large N-dimensional arrays of data. As Numpy largely overlays compiled code written in the C language, it bypasses many of the weaknesses of Python to provide very fast performance for common linear algebra (and other) operations.\n","\n","This notebook doesn't aim to give you a working knowledge of NumPy. Instead, it aims to offer a brief demonstration of the savings which can be made by using NumPy.\n","\n","## Dot Product Example\n","\n","In the example below we generate two random vectors each with 1,000,000 entries and then calculate the dot product of them"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"19sztOuVnbtT","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":349},"outputId":"cce0baac-1aac-4156-b891-589f1eb91771","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1589902547172,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":13710,"user":{"displayName":"Chris Cooling","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjoywtXOtodxpfl7grrq2lU3t3B4xn9dhcbyNsG4w=s64","userId":"16044721281026986520"}}},"source":["!pip install line_profiler\n","import random\n","\n","%load_ext line_profiler\n","\n","def random_dot_product(n):\n","  list_1 = [random.randrange(1, 100, 1) for i in range(n)]\n","  list_2 = [random.randrange(1, 100, 1) for i in range(n)]\n","\n","  return(sum([x*y for x, y in zip(list_1, list_2)]))\n","\n","%lprun -f random_dot_product random_dot_product(1000000)"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting line_profiler\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d8/cc/4237472dd5c9a1a4079a89df7ba3d2924eed2696d68b91886743c728a9df/line_profiler-3.0.2-cp36-cp36m-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl (68kB)\n","\r\u001b[K     |████▊                           | 10kB 20.3MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |█████████▌                      | 20kB 2.1MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |██████████████▎                 | 30kB 3.1MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |███████████████████             | 40kB 4.0MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |███████████████████████▉        | 51kB 2.6MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████▋   | 61kB 3.0MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 71kB 2.6MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: IPython in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from line_profiler) (5.5.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: setuptools>=18.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from IPython->line_profiler) (46.3.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: prompt-toolkit<2.0.0,>=1.0.4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from IPython->line_profiler) (1.0.18)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pexpect;
