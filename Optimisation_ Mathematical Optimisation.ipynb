This may be through:\n","\n","- Using standard mathematical definitions to simplify the algebraic expression being evaluated\n","- Rearranging the algebraic expression being solved for to reduce the number of more expensive operations being carried out\n","\n","Mathemtical operations will be carried out on your computer by passing relevant data to the [Arithemetic Logic Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit) (ALU) on your CPU (or GPU). ALUs typically contain circuits specifically designed to carry out fundamental operations (such as addition) and use combinations of these fundamental operations to perform more complex operations.\n","\n","Every mathematical operator and function will be executed by using one or more operations on your computer's ALU. These operations will take time to execute on your computer's and the number and complexity of operations required will affect the running time. Thus, some operations are more \"expensive\" to perform than others.\n","\n","In the example below we attempt to estimate the time it takes for various calculations to take place. This is made a little harder by the fact that every operation will involve a significant amount of time loading instruction and the value of the variable(s) into the ALU. To remove these overheads we first include line 8 which simply loads a variable. This will have the overhead of loading a variable and instruction (in this case to do nothing) into the ALU but not the cost of the operation itself. Thus, we can subtract the time spent executing line 8 from the time spent executing other lines to find the time cost of the operation on the other lines."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1is_wk5YTmvq","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!pip install line_profiler\n","import math\n","\n","%load_ext line_profiler\n","\n","def mathematical_operators(a,b):\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    a\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    a == b\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    a < b\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    a + b\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    a - b\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    a * b\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    a / b\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    a ** b\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.log(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.log(a, b)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.sqrt(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.exp(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.sin(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.acos(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.tan(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.atan(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.cosh(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.asinh(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.tanh(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.atanh(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.ceil(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.gamma(a)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.factorial(4)\n","  for i in range(1, 10000):\n","    math.factorial(40)\n","\n","%lprun -f mathematical_operators mathematical_operators(0.96, 4.12)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CYkb5pBfTtR7","colab_type":"text"},"source":["The results as calcualted when I executed this code is colab are below:\n","\n","| Operation | Execution time (us per 10,000 operations) |\n","| ----| ---|\n","| == | 255 |\n","| < | 436 |\n","| + | 282 |\n","| - | 383 |\n","| * | 294 |\n","| / | 412 |\n","| ** | 1462 |\n","| math.log(a) | 2022 |\n","| math.log(a, b) | 2222 |\n","| math.sqrt | 1173 |\n","| math.exp | 3499 |\n","| math.sin | 1658 |\n","| math.acos | 1705 |\n","| math.tan | 1761 |\n","| math.atan | 1664 |\n","| math.cosh | 1832 |\n","| math.asinh | 2298 |\n","| math.tanh | 2081 |\n","| math.atanh | 2598 |\n","| math.ceil | 2420 |\n","| math.gamma | 3347 |\n","| math.factorial(4) | 1224 |\n","| math.factorial(40) | 5157 |\n","\n","This is a fairly crude approximation of execution time for different operators and functions, but serves to demonstrate that fundamental arithmetic operators are significantly cheaper than more complex ones.\n","\n","Note as well that when functions should have the same result, the more specialised function will normally have the shorter run-time.
